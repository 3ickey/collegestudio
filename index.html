        <p>
            As we all know there are many delicious world food recipes out there and one doesn’t always need to go to<br>
            that specific country to taste the ultimate dish. We’re afraid to try other cultures’ food because we have<br>
            no idea what goes inside to make it and of course what it tastes like. But what if we did, what if we knew<br>
            the exact ingredients and even try to make it ourselves at home? This web app hovers over the idea of<br>
            accessibility of food recipes. I believe food is the most important thing people gather around for, whether<br>
            that’s with family or friends. And at the interpersonal level It’ll open a new possibility to form<br>
            relationships and communication between people.
            <br>
            <br>The creation of this web app in this space is to simply<br> address the inaccessibility of food recipes
            and to
            present it with beautiful UI elements that will make the <br>user experience a lot better than what we
            experience on the web today. I believe it’ll be highly useful to people:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Who want to try out new recipes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Who are not a very good cook or not at all
                </li>
                <li>
                    Who want to have a general knowledge of where the recipes originate from
                </li>
            </ul>

                    An app that can suggest weekly complete meals with a detailed instruction on how to make it and
